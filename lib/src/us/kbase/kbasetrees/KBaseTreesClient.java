     * support for 'fasta'. The default value if not specified is 'fasta'.
     * The 'sequence_label' specifies what should be placed in the label of each sequence.  'none' indicates that
     * no label is added, so you get the sequence only.  'raw' indicates that the raw label of the alignement row
     * is used. 'feature_id' indicates that the label will have an examplar feature_id in each label (typically the
     * feature that was originally used to define the sequence). Note that exemplar feature_ids are not
     * defined for all alignments, so this may result in an unlabeled alignment.  'protein_sequence_id' indicates
     * that the kbase id of the protein sequence used in the alignment is used.  'contig_sequence_id' indicates that
     * the contig sequence id is used.  Note that trees are typically built with protein sequences OR
     * contig sequences. If you select one type of sequence, but the alignment was built with the other type, then
